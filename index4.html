        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>All of us have heard of the Mumbai local trains, often referred to as the lifeline of the city by Mumbaikars. While these trains are convenient, cost-efficient, and faster than other modes of transport, they suffer from poor crowd management both on the trains and at the stations. Given their popularity, especially among daily commuters, it is essential to manage the crowds effectively. Additionally, first-time visitors to the city often face confusion navigating the extensive rail network. There is a clear need for an efficient guide or recommendation system that suggests places to visit in Mumbai, along with information on travel time, distance, and the nearest stations. Furthermore, with around 88 stations and a large workforce, managing employee data and calculating revenue efficiently is crucial. These challenges were highlighted in the white paper titled "Streets," which discusses life in Mumbai, underscoring the necessity for a solution that can enhance the commuting experience for both residents and tourists.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement Description</h2>
        <p>The inefficiency in crowd management at railway stations during peak hours leads to significant inconvenience for passengers, causing long wait times and overcrowding. This chaos not only frustrates daily commuters but also makes it difficult for first-time visitors to navigate the rail network. There is a pressing need for an effective system that provides real-time insights into crowd density and optimizes travel routes and enhances the passenger experience by dynamically managing crowd levels and offering immediate information about available routes.</p>
